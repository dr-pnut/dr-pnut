## Hi! I'm James!
I am currently learning CyberSecurity as a high school student. I am not doing any specific curriculum, but I am learning a lot. So far, I am learning *operating systems*, *advanced networking*, working on *COMPTIA A+ Certification*. I am also doing guided CTFs on [**_TryHackMe_**](TryHackMe.com).

I usually do not stick to a specific schedule, due to school, sports, and work, but I am trying to become more stable in my schedule.  

Some of my beginner projects are:
- [Simple PHP Web Shell](https://github.com/dr-pnut/WebShell)
- [Spectrum Wifi Cracker](https://github.com/dr-pnut/RedTools/tree/main/Dictionaries/SpectrumWifi)
- [Small File Encryption](https://github.com/dr-pnut/RedTools/tree/main/Malware/FirstRansom)
